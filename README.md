# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Smart-Car
The hand gesture-controlled car project utilizing the NRF24L01 wireless
module, Arduino Nano, motor driver module, accelerometer, offers an exciting opportunity for intuitive and interactive control. By interpreting hand gestures captured by the accelerometer, users can control
the car's movement effortlessly. This project has the potential to enhance
the user experience and showcase the possibilities of gesture-based control
in the field of robotics and automation.
